# Test Execution Status Report

**Date**: October 7, 2025
**Test Run**: Automated Complete Test Suite

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED**

### 1. Contract Deployment
- ✅ All 5 contracts deployed to Sepolia
- ✅ All contracts verified and working
- ✅ Test data (drone & policy) created successfully

### 2. Response Time Testing
- ✅ **100% COMPLETE**
- ✅ File: `test-results/responseTime.json` (23KB)
- ✅ All 4 levels tested (0, 1, 2, 3)
- ✅ All transaction counts (1-20)
- ✅ All 10 repetitions per test
- ✅ **Total: 800 tests successfully completed**

---

## ❌ **FAILED**

### 3. Gas Consumption Testing
- ❌ **FAILED - Network Error**
- ❌ Error: `getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND sepolia.infura.io`
- ❌ Cause: Lost connection to Infura RPC during long test run
- ❌ File: `test-results/gasConsumption.json` (empty - no data)

---

## 📊 **What We Have**

### Response Time Data (COMPLETE ✅)
```
test-results/responseTime.json
- Level 0: 200 tests
- Level 1: 200 tests
- Level 2: 200 tests
- Level 3: 200 tests
Total: 800 successful measurements
```

### Gas Consumption Data (MISSING ❌)
```
test-results/gasConsumption.json
- All levels: 0 transactions (network failure)
```

---

## 🔧 **Next Steps to Complete Project**

### Option 1: Re-run Gas Tests (Recommended)
```bash
cd ethereum

# Make sure internet is stable, then:
node scripts/testGasConsumption.js

# This will take 12-20 hours
# It will save progress after each level
```

### Option 2: Generate Partial Excel (Response Time Only)
We can create an Excel with:
- ✅ All response time data (complete)
- ❌ Gas consumption (marked as "pending")

### Option 3: Use Different RPC
If Infura is unstable, switch to Alchemy:
1. Get Alchemy API key
2. Update .env: `SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY`
3. Re-run gas tests

---

## 💰 **Costs Incurred**

- Deployment: ~0.002 ETH ✅
- Response Time Tests: ~0.01 ETH ✅
- Gas Tests: ~0 ETH (failed before completion) ❌

**Total Spent**: ~0.012 ETH
**Remaining for Gas Tests**: ~0.10-0.15 ETH needed

---

## 📋 **Deliverables Status**

| Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Source Code | ✅ Complete | All 5 contracts |
| Deployment | ✅ Complete | All on Sepolia |
| Response Time Data | ✅ Complete | 800 tests done |
| Gas Consumption Data | ❌ Incomplete | Network failure |
| Excel Report | ⏳ Pending | Waiting for gas data |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete | 7 comprehensive docs |

---

## 🎯 **To Finish the Project**

You need to:

1. **Ensure stable internet connection**
2. **Check you have ~0.15 Sepolia ETH**
3. **Run gas tests**: `node scripts/testGasConsumption.js`
4. **Wait 12-20 hours**
5. **Generate Excel**: `node scripts/exportToExcel.js`

---

## ⚠️ **Network Issue Details**

```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND sepolia.infura.io
Transactions affected: 1973-2000 (Level 3)
Total failed transactions: ~6000+ (across all levels)
```

**Root Cause**: DNS/Network connectivity issue with Infura
**Solution**:
- Fix internet connection, OR
- Switch to Alchemy RPC, OR
- Use mobile hotspot for stable connection

---

## 📈 **Progress**

- **Contracts**: 100% ✅
- **Documentation**: 100% ✅
- **Response Time Tests**: 100% ✅
- **Gas Tests**: 0% ❌
- **Excel**: 0% ⏳

**Overall Project Completion**: ~70%

**To reach 100%**: Re-run gas consumption tests successfully

---

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**Before re-running gas tests:**
1. Test Infura connection: `ping sepolia.infura.io`
2. Or get Alchemy API key (more reliable)
3. Ensure computer won't sleep during 12-20 hour test
4. Monitor first 100 transactions to ensure stability

**Command to re-run:**
```bash
cd D:\projects\ether-blockchain\ethereum
node scripts/testGasConsumption.js > gas-test-output.log 2>&1 &
```

Then check progress:
```bash
tail -f gas-test-output.log
```

---

**Status**: Ready to re-run gas tests when network is stable
